# Gesture-Volume-Controlü§è
A Hand Gesture Volume Control application made using OpenCV &amp; MediaPipe . In this project I have built an OpenCV application in which a user can control his system's (laptop/pc) volume by making some Hand Gestures.

## Features :
* Can change your computer's volume based on your hand activity
* Can track your hand in real-time

### Working :
* This project is a use case of Hand Tracking technology. 
* As soon as the user shows up his hand in the camera the application detects it & draws a bounding box around the hand.
* According to the distance between user's Index finger and Thumb it displays the volume in the volume bar on the screen
* To set the volume as the system's volume user has to bend his pinky finger simultaneously.

### Tech Stacksüíª:
- OpenCV (for image processing and drawing)
- Mediapipe (for Hand Tracking)
- Pycaw (to link up with the system's volume)
